Netbeans PHP Editor Extensions:
==============================

No Warranty whatsoever for this, it might break your Netbeans ;-)
Only tested with netbeans 6.7, uses APIs that are not in 6.5.
The module automatically scans for the "phpcs" executable inside the enviroment path.

Currently this module has two little features:

1. PHP Coding Standards Support for the Tasks Window
2. Additionall "Show Coding Standards Violations" for Inline Highlighting of Violations

TASK WINDOW
==============

Open up the Tasks Window from "Window - Tasks" or CTRL+6.

To enable the Todo List CS Scanning you have to right click on the Filter Icon
and Select "Edit". Add a New Filter "Coding Standards" and activate only "PHP Coding Standards"
as task group and confirm. Then you have to click the uppermost icon on the left
of the tasks window that enables "Current File Scope".

For performance reasons the PHPCS plugin will only work in this mode, which
means only the coding standard violations of the current file are shown
in the task window.

SHOW CODING VIOLATIONS
======================

Per right click on the Editor window you can select "Show Coding Standard" which
highlights lines with warnings and errors. This highlights disappear when the file
is changed and saved.

CONFIGURE CODING-STANDARD
=========================

In the Advanced/Miscellaneous Tab of the Options Dialog you can chose which
coding standard you want to use and where the PHPCS binary (script) is located.

TODOS
=====

* Add project level Coding Standard Configuration
